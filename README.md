10 alternate paths you can take each of which brings a whole extra layer to the path that you take. adds a whole complex layer. each of these paths gets you a log that unlocks different abilities? different endings?

LOVER - LOVE: 1 path about falling in love - always ends in heartbreak unless you give up the story pink log: be yourself you move at normal speed even with logs. Ending with lover log is the grandpa has a wife.

BOSS - JOB: cut down trees - with ax 1 path about getting a successful job - always ends in being alone - a money system appears when you're in that section of the game and the more trees you cut down the more money you earn. If you get to a certain amount of money the normal section of the game is cut out and the only way back is to buy the log gold log. Then a boss battle appears. He throws coins at you and you have to place logs to block the coins. 

1 path about doing whatever you want - you can't reach the ending 

MECHANIC - TRAVEL 1 path about traveling the world - you learn a lot but you have no home

BARTENDER - VICES: 1 path about giving into vices - you become a shell of yourself

FRIENDS - FRIENDSHIP: 1 path about friendship - you are happy but not indivdualistic 

INSPIRATION - ART: 1 path about becoming an artist - you are your worst critic

TEACHER - LEARNING: you can go to school

CHEF - FOOD: you make food 

1 path about creating a game - you are here







THE MAIN PATH: BORN GROW UP WORK EAT LIVE DIE

HOW TO NAVIGATE A STORY LIKE THIS WHAT GAMEPLAY IS THE NARRAIVATIVE. 

LIFE YOU ARE MOVING FORWARD


you are tasked with getting somewhere or delivering something and along the way you can meet people to change the game in different ways.

The first character you meet is a girl who tasks you with going on a date with her you can fall in love with her and completely forget about delivering wood and this causes you to get married get a house but years later you can deliver wood to an empty house with your grandpa dead because he froze to death. Game becomes literally stardew valley with a bunch of stuff to do.

when you move backwards for too long a white cat comes on the screen and starts slowly moving after you, if it touches you, you have to fight it which progressively gets more hard as you face it more and more. The actual battle is that you have to pet the cat.

One of the things you can do is go to school and you have a  test and during the test you know literally nothing but it becomes a puzzle that you have to figure out on the test. Make it a hard math problem.

Another one is a bar but you have to move completely left, first you want to take a break so you move a little to the left. When you come out of the hotel a new sign appears that shows a bar to the left, and you can go to it but its a long path. Darts at the bar.
